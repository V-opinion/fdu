  <h1 style="font-size:28px; margin:0 0 16px 0;">What Is a Multi-Religion Election System?</h1>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    A multi-religion election system is a democratic model that gives
    different religious communities a formal role in political decision‑making.
    Instead of treating religion only as a private matter, it recognizes that
    faith can strongly influence how people vote, and it builds this reality
    into the design of elections and representation.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The multi-religious electoral system is a reaction to the incomplete
    separation between state and church, and between religion and politics.
    It is presented as a conflict resolution model primarily aimed at the
    complicated and intractable 77‑year‑old conflict between Israel and
    Palestine. It asks why none of the UN Secretaries‑General, popes, American
    presidents, kings, politicians, mediators or Nobel Peace Prize laureates
    have succeeded in resolving this conflict so that it is not passed down
    from one generation to the next.<p>
  To understand the idea behind this project, read our main explainer:
  <a href="https://multireligionvalsystem.eu.org/What-is-a-multi-religion-election-system.html">
    What is a multi-religion election system?
  </a>
</p>
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The multi-religious electoral system is a theoretical model that describes
    the background to, and offers an analysis of, the incomplete separation
    between state and church and between religion and politics – a separation
    that helps prevent the conflict between Israel and Palestine from being
    resolved.
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin:24px 0 12px 0;">Historical and modern examples of religious conflict</h2>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The model is illustrated through typical cases from both ancient and modern
    wars, where religion and politics are tightly connected:
  </p>

  <ul style="margin:0 0 12px 20px; padding:0;">
    <li style="margin:0 0 8px 0;">
      The assassination of a former prime minister, Jew and Nobel Peace Prize
      laureate who participated in the Oslo Accords – a murder carried out by
      religious Jewish extremists. Here the religious motive deters even those
      who work for peace.
    </li>
    <li style="margin:0 0 8px 0;">
      The conflict in Northern Ireland between Catholics and Protestants, a
      religiously coloured conflict that lasted about 30 years but was
      eventually resolved.
    </li>
    <li style="margin:0 0 8px 0;">
      The Thirty Years’ War in Europe, where Sweden as a Protestant power and
      parts of Germany as Catholic powers fought a long religious conflict that
      was also eventually resolved.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin:24px 0 12px 0;">A reaction to unequal democracy in religious communities</h2>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The multi-religious electoral system is also a reaction to why the Nordic
    countries have introduced democracy into their Protestant religious
    communities through church elections, while many other countries have not
    done so.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    Within the European Union, only three countries – Sweden, Denmark and
    Finland – have introduced democracy in their religious communities in the
    form of church elections. The other EU member states have not given their
    religious communities the same democratic structures.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The model also reacts to the fact that young Protestants who have reached
    the age of 16 are allowed to practice democracy two years before the
    general election, by voting in church elections. Young people belonging to
    other religious communities – including Catholics and Orthodox Christians
    as well as Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus – are not given the same
    democratic opportunity in their communities.
  </p>

  <h2 style="font-size:22px; margin:24px 0 12px 0;">Gender and leadership in religious democracy</h2>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The multi-religious electoral system is further a reaction to why the
    papacy always goes to a man, and why only men are allowed to elect the
    pope. This stands in contrast to church elections in some Protestant
    contexts, where a woman can become an archbishop.
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    It raises questions such as: Can a woman be a chaplain or priest in the
    American Congress? Will Americans introduce democracy into their religious
    communities in a way that treats men and women equally and gives believers
    a direct democratic voice?
  </p>

  <p style="margin:0 0 12px 0;">
    The multi-religion election system is thus both a theoretical framework
    and a criticism of current relationships between religion and politics.
    It suggests that durable peace – especially in long‑running conflicts like
    Israel–Palestine – requires new democratic structures that take religious
    communities seriously while fully protecting individual human rights.
